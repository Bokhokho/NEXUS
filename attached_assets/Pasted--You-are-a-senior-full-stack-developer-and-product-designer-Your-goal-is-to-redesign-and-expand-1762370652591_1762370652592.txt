

You are a senior full-stack developer and product designer.
Your goal is to redesign and expand the existing Next.js 14 + Prisma + Neon + Tailwind + shadcn/ui web app called “Sorcerer.”

It’s currently deployed at https://sourcer-zgsk.vercel.app/. The app already has functional routes like /gate and /importer connected to a Neon Postgres database via Prisma.

You must create a fully modern SaaS dashboard experience that keeps all functionality but adds new pages, better navigation, and a consistent design system.

🧱 1. Core Objectives

Keep all existing business logic (auth gate, importer, database, APIs).

Build a unified dashboard layout with:

Sidebar navigation (collapsible, icon-based, with hover tooltips)

Top navigation bar (user info, notifications, theme toggle, search)

Ensure all pages share the same layout and style system.

Add light/dark mode toggle using shadcn/ui theme system.

All tables must be:

Searchable

Sortable

Filterable

Exportable (CSV or Excel)

Include chart visualizations (bar/pie/line) using recharts or chart.js for:

User activity

Contractor stats

Import performance

Include a real-time “Recent Actions” feed and “Notifications” dropdown.

🧩 2. Pages to Include and Improve

Rebuild the following routes with modern UI and logic hooks:

Route	Purpose
/gate	Minimal password + identity selector screen with brand logo.
/importer	Advanced contractor importer with table, filters, and status update.
/responsive	Manage contractors marked as responsive (filters, export, charts).
/sourcing	Team view — tabs per member, draggable contractor assignments.
/dashboard	Central overview page with charts, metrics, and links to other sections.
/activity	Full audit log view with timestamps, filters, and export.
/settings	Manage app password, admin passcode, and API keys (local only).
/team	Manage team members (list, add/remove, assign roles).
/reports	Generate and download CSV/PDF reports with charts and filters.
/support	Help center and contact links.
/notifications	Separate page showing full notification history.
/profile	User preferences, theme selection, etc.
/404	Beautiful custom 404 page with the Sorcerer logo and return button.

You may add additional routes that fit logically (like /analytics, /projects, /contracts, etc.) to improve data visibility.

🧠 3. Design System

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Tailwind Variants

Animations: Framer Motion

Icons: lucide-react

Charts: recharts

State: React Server Components + Hooks

Layout:

Sidebar (left): app logo (“Sorcerer”), main links with icons, hover labels.

Topbar: search bar, theme toggle, notification bell, user avatar dropdown.

Font: a clean modern sans-serif (Inter or Poppins).

Accent Color: pick one complementary to the theme (AI may choose best tone).

Logo: a minimal sorcerer icon in SVG form (AI-generated or from Lucide).

🎨 4. Branding and Feel

App Name: Sorcerer

Mood: professional yet magical — a “smart assistant for contractor sourcing.”

Use subtle gradients, soft shadows, and responsive breakpoints.

Components should look native to Vercel/Dashboard style apps.

Dark mode should feel futuristic with glowing accents.

All pages must be responsive for desktop and tablet.

⚙️ 5. Functionality Enhancements

Global layout wrapper for all routes.

Breadcrumbs for navigation context.

Real-time feedback messages (e.g., success toasts).

Form validation with React Hook Form and Zod.

Modular component structure: /components/ui, /components/layout, /components/dashboard, etc.

Notifications fetched from a mock endpoint or Prisma Notification model.

Activity feed auto-refreshes every few seconds.

Charts update dynamically using mock data.

📦 6. Deliverables

Complete Next.js 14 project structure.

All pages in app/ directory, styled and wired into the sidebar/topbar layout.

Pre-configured tailwind.config.js and components.json for shadcn.

Example Prisma schema extension:

model Notification {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  message   String
  type      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  read      Boolean  @default(false)
}

model ActivityLog {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  user      String
  action    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}


components/layout/Sidebar.tsx, Topbar.tsx, and reusable Card/Table components.

Pre-seed data for charts and tables to demo functionality.

Readme section explaining how to add more pages easily.

🚀 7. Output Format

Deliver in one zipped repository structure (or structured code blocks).

All pages ready for direct deployment to Vercel.

Include concise comments explaining structure and customization points.

Focus on clean, reusable code and modular design.
